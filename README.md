In this project, you will build a Recipe tracking app. The app will allow a user to add new recipes, display a list of recipes and delete a recipe from the list by clicking a delete button. You will also be asked to add styling as provided in the mockup.

Find the TODO comments in the code and create the necessary functionality. Below is a list of specific items you will need to complete for this checkpoint.

App will display a recipe's name, cuisine, photo, ingredients, preparation instructions and action buttons (edit and delete).
Create at least one additional component that is used by the RecipeList component.
It does not need to match the exact appearance of the mockup, but should be similar and pass the styling tests.
Add handlers and other attributes to the starter code as needed.
